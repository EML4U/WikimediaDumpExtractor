==Origins==
{{main|History of anarchism}}
[[Image:WilliamGodwin.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Godwin]] is credited as one of the founders of modern anarchism.]]
Opposition to state and hierarchy had a long history prior to the anarchists in nineteenth century Europe. Some claim anarchist themes can be found in the works of [[Taoist]] sage [[Laozi|Lao Tzu]].<ref name="EB1910">Peter Kropotkin, [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/kropotkin/britanniaanarchy.html "Anarchism"], ''[[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], 1910</ref> <ref>[http://www.religionandnature.com/ern/sample/Clark--Anarchism.pdf "Anarchism"], ''The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature''</ref> [[Diogenes of Sinope]] and the [[Cynics]] and their contemporary, [[Zeno of Citium]], the founder of [[Stoicism]], also introduced similar topics.<ref name="EB1910"/>

Modern anarchism, however, sprung from the secular thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], particularly [[Rousseau]]'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.<ref name=Encarta>"Anarchism", ''[[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia'' 2006 (UK version)</ref> Although by the turn of the 19th century the term "anarchist" had an entirely positive connotation, it first entered the English language in 1642 during the [[English Civil War]] as a term of [[abuse]] used by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] to damn those who were fermenting disorder.<ref name=bbc/> By the time of the [[French Revolution]] some, such as the ''Enragés,''{{huh}} began to use the term positively,<ref>Sheehan, Sean.

The first to describe himself as anarchist was [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]],<ref name=bbc>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20061207.shtml "Anarchism"], [[BBC Radio 4]] program, [[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]], Thursday [[December 7]] [[2006]].

H. Cohen (New York: Vanguard Press, 1927), p.45. </ref> and where "business transactions alone produce the social order."<ref>Proudon, Pierre-Joseph. The Federal Principle. "The notion of ''anarchy'' in politics is just as rational and positive as any other. It means that once industrial functions have taken over from political functions, then business transactions alone produce the social order."</ref> Like Godwin, Proudhon opposed violent revolutionary action. He saw anarchy as "a form of government or constitution in which public and private consciousness, formed through the development of science and law, is alone sufficient to maintain order and guarantee all liberties. In it, as a consequence, the institutions of the police, preventive and repressive methods, officialdom, taxation, etc., are reduced to a minimum. In it, more especially, the forms of monarchy and intensive centralization disappear, to be replaced by federal institutions and a pattern of life based on the commune."<ref>''Selected Writings'', Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</ref>

===Mutualism===
[[Image:Proudhon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualist]] [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] was the first self-described anarchist.]]
{{main|Mutualism (economic theory)}}
Mutualism began in 19th century English and French labor movements, then took an anarchist form associated with [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in France and others in the US.<ref>"A member of a community," ''The Mutualist''; this 1826 series criticized [[Robert Owen]]'s proposals, and has been attributed to Josiah Warren or another dissident Owenite in the same circles; Wilbur, Shawn, 2006, "More from the 1826 "Mutualist"?"</ref> This influenced individualist anarchists in the United States such as [[Benjamin Tucker]] and [[William B. Greene]]; In the 1840s and 1850s, [[Charles A. Dana]],<ref>Dana, Charles A. ''[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/proudhon/dana.html Proudhon and his "Bank of the People"]'' (1848).</ref> and Greene introduced Proudhon's works to the US. Greene adapted Proudhon's mutualism to American conditions and introduced it to Tucker.<ref>Tucker, Benjamin R., "On Picket Duty", ''Liberty (Not the Daughter but the Mother of Order) (1881-1908)''; [[5 January]] [[1889]]; 6, 10; APS Online pg. 1</ref>

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. Many mutualists{{who?}} believe a market without government intervention drives prices to labor-costs, eliminating profit, rent, and interest according to the [[labor theory of value]]. Firms would be forced to compete over workers just as workers compete over firms, raising wages.<ref>"Communism versus Mutualism", ''Socialistic, Communistic, Mutualistic and Financial Fragments''. (Boston: Lee & Shepard, 1875)|[[William Batchelder Greene]]: "Under the mutual system, each individual will receive the just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount; and so much as the individual laborer will then get over and above what he has earned will come to him as his share in the general prosperity of the community of which he is an individual member."</ref>

Some see mutualism as an ideology falling between individualist and collectivist anarchism.<ref>Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America'', Princeton University Press 1996 ISBN 0-691-04494-5, p.6<br/>Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought, Blackwell Publishing 1991 ISBN 0-631-17944-5, p.11</ref> In ''What Is Property?'', Proudhon develops a concept of "liberty", equivalent to "anarchy", which is the dialectical "synthesis of communism and property."<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph [http://etext.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/ProProp.html ''What is Property?''] (1840), p. 281</ref> Greene, influenced by [[Pierre Leroux]], sought mutualism in the synthesis of three philosophies — communism, capitalism and socialism.<ref>Greene, William B. "Communism — Capitalism — Socialism", ''Equality'' (1849)[http://www.libertarian-labyrinth.org/greene/wbg-css.html], p. 59. </ref> Later individualist anarchists used the term mutualism but retained little emphasis on synthesis, while [[social anarchism|social anarchists]] such as the authors of [[An Anarchist FAQ]] claim mutualism as a subset of their philosophical tradition.<ref name="faq-social"/>

===Individualist anarchism===
{{main|Individualist anarchism}}
Individualist anarchism comprises "several traditions"<ref>Ward, Colin. ''Anarchism: A Very Short Introduction''. [[Oxford University Press]], 2004, p. 2</ref> which hold that "individual conscience and the pursuit of self-interest should not be constrained by any collective body or public authority."<ref>Heywood, Andrew, Key Concepts in Politics, Palgrave, ISBN 0-312-23381-7, 2000, p. 46</ref> Individualist anarchism is supportive of property being held privately, unlike the social/socialist/collectivist/communitarian wing which advocates common ownership.<ref>Freeden, Micheal. ''Ideologies and Political Theory: A Conceptual Approach''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 019829414X. pp. 314</ref>  Individualist anarchism has been espoused by individuals such as [[Henry David Thoreau]]<ref>Johnson, Ellwood. ''The Goodly Word: The Puritan Influence in America Literature'', Clements Publishing, 2005, p. 138: "…a political theory that has usually been named 'anarchist individualism'…The theory, however, does not advocate anarchism in the sense, for example, of the destruction of institutions; its purpose is only description. Emersonian and Thoreauavian anarchism does not call for any specifiable program of rebellion or destruction of social institutions, but merely asserts one abiding truth…" ''Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences'', edited by Edwin Robert Anderson Seligman, Alvin Saunders Johnson, 1937, p. 12: "The noblest and most eloquent statement of this essentially anarchist individualism came a generation later in Thoreau's essay on Civil Disobedience" Bool, Henry, [http://praxeology.net/HB-AJA.htm'' Henry Bool's Apology for His Jeffersonian Anarchism''], 1901: "I am a believer in the doctrines of the individualistic school of Anarchists, to which Garrison, Emerson, Proudhon, Thoreau, Spooner, Andrews, Warren and Tucker belong."</ref> [[Josiah Warren]], and [[Murray Rothbard]]. [[William Godwin]], regarded by some as an individualist anarchist,<ref>Woodcock,  George. 2004. ''Anarchism: A History Of Libertarian Ideas And Movements''. Broadview Press. p. 20</ref> advocated benevolence but also defended the sanctity of "private judgement" for each individual over his own labor and his property, and predicted a progressive rationalism that would result in government becoming smaller over time until eventual disappearance.
[[Image:Max stirner.jpg|thumb|[[19th century philosophy|19th century philosopher]] [[Max Stirner]], a prominent early [[individualist anarchist]] (sketch by [[Friedrich Engels]]).]]
One of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism was [[Max Stirner]],<ref name="SEP-Stirner">{{sep entry|max-stirner|Max Stirner}}</ref> who wrote ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'' (1844), a "founding text" of the philosophy.<ref name = "SEP-Stirner"/> [[Philosophy of Max Stirner|Stirner's philosophy]] was an "[[Egoism|egoist]]" form of individualist anarchism according to which the individual does as he/she pleases, taking no notice of God, state, or moral rules,<ref>Miller, David.

''Anarchism: Left, Right and Green'', San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1994, pp. 95-96</ref> To Stirner, rights were ''[[reification|spooks]]'' in the mind, and society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality" — he supported property as possession by might rather than right.<ref>"What my might reaches is my property; and let me claim as property everything I feel myself strong enough to attain, and let me extend my actual property as fas as ''I'' entitle, that is, empower myself to take…" In Ossar, Michael. 1980.

Anarchism: A History of Libertarian Ideas and Movements. Broadview Press. p 20</ref>

A "less radical"<ref name=encarta7/> form of individualist anarchism was advocated by the "Boston anarchists," individualists who supported private property and a [[free market]].<ref>"Anarchism is a word without meaning, unless it includes the liberty of the individual to control his product or whatever his product has brought him through exchange in a free market - that is, private property. Whoever denies private property is of necessity an Archist." "Anarchism and Property", by Benjamin Tucker in ''The New Freewoman'', [[November 15]] [[1913]]</ref> They advocated the protection of liberty and property by private contractors,<ref>[[Benjamin Tucker]], "defense is a service like any other service; that it is labor both useful and desired, and therefore an economic commodity subject to the law of supply and demand; that in a free market this commodity would be furnished at the cost of production; that, competition prevailing, patronage would go to those who furnished the best article at the lowest price; that the production and sale of this commodity are now monopolized by the State; and that the State, like almost all monopolists, charges exorbitant prices" "Instead of a Book" (1893)<br/>
"Anarchism does not exclude prisons, officials, military, or other symbols of force. It merely demands that non-invasive men shall not be made the victims of such force. Anarchism is not the reign of love, but the reign of justice. It does not signify the abolition of force-symbols but the application of force to real invaders." Tucker, Benjamin. ''Liberty'' [[October 19]] [[1891]].</ref> and endorsed exchange of labor for wages,<ref>Tucker, Benjamin.

Collectivist anarchism (a specific tendency not to be confused with the broad category sometimes called [[collectivist]] or [[communitarian]] anarchism<ref>Morris, Christopher W. 1998. ''An Essay on the Modern State''. Cambridge University Press. p 50. The collectivist ''category'' is also sometimes known as social, socialist, or communitarian anarchism category.</ref>) is most commonly associated with [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and with [[Johann Most]].<ref>Avrich, Paul. 2006. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. [[AK Press]]. p. 5</ref> Unlike mutualists, collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivized. However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism. Although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labor, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.<ref>Bakunin's associate, [[James Guillaume]], put it this way in his essay, ''[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/guillaume/works/ideas.htm Ideas on Social Organization]''(1876): "When… production comes to outstrip consumption… [e]veryone will draw what he needs from the abundant social reserve of commodities, without fear of depletion; and the moral sentiment which will be more highly developed among free and equal workers will prevent, or greatly reduce, abuse and waste."</ref> Collective anarchism arose contemporaneously with [[Marxism]] but opposed the Marxist [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], despite Marxism striving for a collectivist stateless society.<ref>Bakunin, Mikhail; ''[http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/anarfaq.htm Statism and Anarchism]'': "They [the Marxists] maintain that only a dictatorship — their dictatorship, of course — can create the will of the people, while our answer to this is: No dictatorship can have any other aim but that of self-perpetuation, and it can beget only slavery in the people tolerating it; freedom can be created only by freedom, that is, by a universal rebellion on the part of the people and free organization of the toiling masses from the bottom up."</ref>

[[Image:Kropotkin Nadar.jpg|thumb|left|Anarcho-communist [[Peter Kropotkin]] believed that in [[anarchy]], workers would spontaneously self-organize to produce goods in common for all society.]]
Anarchist communists propose that a society composed of a number of [[self-governance|self-governing]] [[Commune (socialism)|communes]] with [[collectivism|collective]] use of the [[means of production]] and [[direct democracy]] as the political organizational form, and related to other communes through [[federation]] would be the freest form of social organisation.<ref name="LibCom"/> However, some anarchist communists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy, feeling that it can impede individual liberty and favor [[consensus democracy]].<ref>[[David Graeber|Graeber, David]] and Grubacic, Andrej.

In anarchist communism, individuals would not receive direct [[Remuneration|compensation]] for labour (through sharing of [[profit]]s or payment), but would instead have free access to the resources and surplus of the [[Commune (socialism)|commune]].<ref>Miller.

====Anarcho-syndicalism====
{{main|Syndicalism|Anarcho-syndicalism}}
[[Image:Anarchist flag.svg|right|thumb|A common anarcho-syndicalist flag.]]
{{rewrite-section}}
In the early twentieth century anarcho-syndicalism arose as a distinct school of thought within anarchism. With greater focus on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, syndicalism posits radical [[trade union]]s as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically [[Workers' self-management|self-managed by the workers]]. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership of the means of production, which they believe lead to class divisions. Important principles of syndicalism include workers' solidarity, [[direct action]] (such as [[general strike]]s and [[recovered factory|workplace recuperations]]), and [[workers' self-management]].

Anarcho-syndicalism and other branches of anarchism are not mutually exclusive: anarcho-syndicalists often subscribe to communist or collectivist anarchism. Its advocates propose labour organization as a means to create the foundations of a non-hierarchical anarchist society within the current system and bring about social revolution. 
According to [[An Anarchist FAQ]], anarcho-syndicalist economic systems often take the form of either a [[Collectivist anarchism|collectivist anarchist]] economic system or a [[anarcho-communism|anarcho-communist]] economic system.<ref name="faq-social">"[http://www.infoshop.org/faq/secA3.html#seca32Are there different types of social anarchism?]", [[An Anarchist FAQ]].

[[Rudolf Rocker]] was a leading early anarcho-syndicalist thinker who outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet ''Anarchosyndicalism''.<ref name="faq-social"/><ref>[http://www.spunk.org/library/writers/rocker/sp001495/rocker_as1.html ''Anarchosyndicalism]'' by [[Rudolf Rocker]], retrieved [[7 September]] [[2006]]</ref> Although more frequently associated with labor struggles of the early twentieth century (particularly in [[Anarchism in France|France]] and [[Anarchism in Spain|Spain]]), many syndicalist organizations are active today, including the [[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden|SAC]] in Sweden, the [[Unione Sindacale Italiana|USI]] in Italy, and the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]] in Spain. A number of these organizations are united across national borders by membership in the [[International Workers Association]].

</ref> a number of new movements and schools have emerged.

[[Post-left anarchy]] seeks to distance itself from the traditional "[[left-wing politics|left]]" and to escape the confines of [[ideology]] in general. Post-leftists argue that anarchism has been weakened by its long attachment to contrary "leftist" movements and single issue causes and calls for a synthesis of anarchist thought and a specifically anti-authoritarian revolutionary movement outside of the leftist milieu. [[Post-anarchism]] is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and [[poststructuralist]] thought developed by [[Saul Newman]] and associated with thinkers such as [[Todd May]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]. It draws from a wide range of ideas including [[autonomism]], post-left anarchy, [[situationism]], [[post-colonialism]] and Zapatismo. Another recent form of anarchism critical of formal anarchist movements is [[insurrectionary anarchism]] which advocates informal organization and active resistance to the state; its proponents include [[Wolfi Landstreicher]] and [[Alfredo M. Bonanno]].

==== Anarcha-feminism ====
{{main|Anarcha-feminism}}
[[Image:Anfem.svg|thumb|A purple and black flag is often used to represent [[Anarcha-feminism]].]]
Anarcha-feminism synthesizes [[radical feminism]] and anarchism that views [[patriarchy]] (male domination over women) as a fundamental manifestation of involuntary hierarchy to which anarchists are opposed. Anarcha-feminism was inspired in the late [[19th century]] by the writings of early feminist anarchists such as [[Lucy Parsons]], [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Voltairine de Cleyre]]. Anarcha-feminists, like other radical feminists, criticize and advocate the abolition of traditional conceptions of family, education and [[gender role]]s. Anarcha-feminists also often criticize the views of some of the traditional anarchists such as [[Mikhail Bakunin]] who have believed that patriarchy is only a minor problem and is dependent only on the existence of the state and capitalism and will disappear soon after such institutions are abolished.{{disputed-inline}} Anarcha-feminists by contrast view patriarchy as a fundamental problem in society and believe that the feminist struggle against sexism and patriarchy is a essential component of the anarchist struggle against the [[state]] and [[capitalism]]. [[L. Susan Brown]] expressed the sentiment that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist".<ref>[[L. Susan Brown|Brown, Susan]]. "Beyond Feminism:  Anarchism and Human Freedom" ''Anarchist Papers 3'' Black Rose Books (1990) p. 208</ref>

====Green anarchism====
{{main|Green anarchism}}
{{rewrite-section}}
[[Image:Darker green and Black flag.svg|right|thumb|Green and black flag of Green Anarchism.]]
Green anarchism is a school of thought within anarchism which emphasizes [[the environment]]. Primitivist and anti-civilization green anarchists advocate a return to a [[pre-industrial]] and usually pre-agricultural society.<ref>Nocella, Anthony. Best, Stephen. 'Igniting a Revolution: Voices in Defense of the Earth' AK Press (2006) pg.23</ref> They critique [[industrial civilization]] from the perspective that [[technology]] and [[technology development|development]] have [[Social alienation|alienated]] people from the natural world.{{Who|date=October 2007}} This strand of green anarchism philosophy develops themes present in the political action of the [[Luddites]] and the writings of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], although when primitivism emerged it was influenced more directly by the works of theorists such as the [[Frankfurt School]] [[Marxists]] [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]]; and [[anthropologists]] [[Marshall Sahlins]] and [[Richard Borshay Lee]]. Green anarchists such as [[Derrick Jensen]] and [[John Zerzan]], identifying themselves as primitivists, advocate a complete process of '[[rewilding]]' and a return to [[nomadic]] [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles.<ref>''Endgame, Volume 1: The Problem of Civilization'', Seven Stories Press (ISBN 1-58322-730-X)</ref><ref name=WhatIsAnarchism>[http://www.insurgentdesire.org.uk/whatisanarchism.htm John Zerzan - What is Anarchism?]</ref> 

Other green anarchists{{who?|date=November 2007}} only wish to see an end to industrial society and do not necessarily oppose [[domestication]] or [[agriculture]]. Yet other green anarchists{{who?|date=November 2007}} focus not on a post-revolutionary future, but on defense of the earth and social revolution in the present. Many non-primitivist green anarchists, such as anthropologist [[Brian Morris (anthropologist)|Brian Morris]], are influenced by the [[social ecology]] of [[Murray Bookchin]].

===Anarchism without adjectives===
{{main|Anarchism without adjectives}}
[[Image:Cleyere.jpg|thumb|left|[[Voltairine de Cleyre]] was an anarchist without adjectives active in the late 19th century who rejected socialist/communist forms of anarchism for their need for regulation, and mutualist/individualist forms for their hard [[propertarian]]ism.]]
''Anarchism without adjectives'', in the words of historian George Richard Esenwein, "referred to an [[hyphen|unhyphenated]] form of anarchism, that is, a doctrine without any qualifying labels such as [[Anarchist communism|communist]], [[collectivism|collectivist]], [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualist]], or [[individualist anarchism|individualist]]. For others,…[it] was simply understood as an attitude that tolerated the coexistence of different anarchist schools".<ref>Esenwein, George Richard "Anarchist Ideology and the Working Class Movement in Spain, 1868-1898" [p. 135] </ref> ''Anarchism without adjectives'' emphasizes harmony between various anarchist factions and attempts to unite them around their shared anti-authoritarian beliefs. 
The expression was coined by [[Cuba]]n-born [[Fernando Tarrida del Mármol]], who used it in [[Barcelona]] in November 1889 as a call for [[tolerance]], after being troubled by the "bitter debates" between the different anarchist movements.<ref>Avrich, Paul. ''Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America''. Princeton University Press, 1996, p. 6</ref> 

[[Voltairine de Cleyre]] was an anarchist without adjectives who initially identified herself as an individualist anarchist but later espoused a collectivist form of anarchism,<ref>"The best thing ordinary workingmen or women could do was to organise their industry to get rid of money altogether…Let them produce together, co-operatively rather than as employer and employed; let them fraternise group by group, let each use what he needs of his own product, and deposit the rest in the storage-houses, and let those others who need goods have them as occasion arises." Voltairine De Cleyre, "Why I Am an Anarchist"</ref> while refusing to identify herself with any of the contemporary schools. She commented that "Socialism and Communism both demand a degree of joint effort and administration which would beget more regulation than is wholly consistent with ideal Anarchism; Individualism and Mutualism, resting upon property, involve a development of the private policeman not at all compatible with my notion of freedom" although she stopped short of denouncing these tendencies as un-anarchistic.<ref>"There is nothing un-Anarchistic about any of [these systems] until the element of compulsion enters and obliges unwilling persons to remain in a community whose economic arrangements they do not agree to."{{cn|date=January 2008}}</ref> [[Errico Malatesta]] was another proponent of anarchism without adjectives, stating that "[i]t is not right for us, to say the least, to fall into strife over mere hypotheses."<ref>[[Max Nettlau|Nettlau, Max]]. ''A Short History of Anarchism'' [p. 198-9]</ref> [[Fred Woodworth]] is a contemporary anarchist without adjectives.<ref>"I have no prefix or adjective for my anarchism.

==Anarchism as a social movement==
{{Splitsection|date=August 2007}}
{{Citations missing|section|date=November 2007}}
Anarchism as a [[social movement]] has regularly endured fluctuations in popularity. Its classical period, which scholars demarcate as from 1860 to 1939, is associated with the working-class movements of the nineteenth century and the [[Spanish Civil War]]-era struggles against [[fascism]].<ref>Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen, "Introduction: Why Anarchism Still Matters", in Jonathan Purkis and James Bowen (eds), ''Changing Anarchism: Anarchist Theory and Practice in a Global Age'' (Manchester: [[Manchester University Press]], 2004), p.3.</ref>
===The First International===
[[Image:FRE-AIT.svg|thumb|right|Logo first used by the Federal Council of Spain of the International Workingmen's Association.]]
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the [[revolutions of 1848]],{{context needed}} but in 1864 the [[International Workingmen's Association]] (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of [[Proudhon]], [[Blanquists]], [[Freemasons]] ([[Philadelphes]]), English trade unionists, [[socialists]] and [[social democrats]].{{Fact|date=December 2007}} Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organization. [[Karl Marx]] became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualists]], opposed Marx's [[state socialism]], advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the [[League of Peace and Freedom]] (LPF), [[Mikhail Bakunin]] and his associates joined the First International - which had decided not to get involved with the LPF. They allied themselves with the anti-authoritarian socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property. At first, the [[collectivist anarchism|collectivists]] worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarized into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads.{{Fact|date=December 2007}}

Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the [[ruling class]] they had fought against.<ref name="bakuninmarx"/><ref>{{cite book|last=Bakunin|first=Mikhail|authorlink=Mikhail Bakunin|origyear=1873|year = 1991|title =Statism and Anarchy | publisher = Cambridge University Press| id = ISBN 0-521-36973-8}}</ref> In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups, when, at the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress]], Marx engineered the expulsion of Bakunin and [[James Guillaume]] from the International and had its headquarters transferred to New York.{{Fact|date=December 2007}} In response, the anti-authoritarian sections formed their own International at the [[Anarchist St. Imier International|St. Imier Congress]], adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.<ref name=Graham-05>Graham, Robert '[http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm 'Anarchism''] (Montreal: Black Rose Books 2005) ISBN 1-55164-251-4</ref>

===Anarchism and organized labor===
{{main|Anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchism in Spain}}
{{missing information|[[Haymarket Riot|The Haymarket Strike]]}}
[[Image:Woman with cntfai flag.jpg|thumb|left|Spanish anarcho-syndicalists successfully organized [[Anarchist communities#Spanish revolution .281936 to 1939.29|autonomous communities]] during the [[Spanish Revolution]] (1936 – 1939).]]
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organization of labor."<ref> Resolutions from the St. Imier Congress, in ''Anarchism: A Documentary History of Libertarian Ideas'', Vol. 1, p.100 [http://www.blackrosebooks.net/anarism1.htm]</ref> In 1907, the [[International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam]] gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the [[anarchist movement]], including [[Errico Malatesta]], [[Pierre Monatte]], [[Luigi Fabbri]], [[Benoît Broutchoux]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[Rudolf Rocker]], [[Christiaan Cornelissen]], etc. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, [[popular education]] issues, the [[general strike]] or [[anti-militarism]]. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and [[syndicalism]] (or [[trade-union]]ism). Malatesta and Monatte in particular opposed themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social [[revolution]], while Malatesta considered that syndicalism by itself was not sufficient.<ref>[http://www.fondation-besnard.org/article.php3?id_article=225 Extract of Malatesta's declaration] {{fr icon}}</ref> Malatesta thought that trade-unions were [[reformist]], and could even be, at times, [[conservative]]. Along with Cornelissen, he cited as example [[Labor unions in the United States|US trade-unions]], where trade-unions composed of qualified workers sometimes opposed themselves to non-qualified workers in order to defend their relatively privileged position.

The Spanish Workers Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics and played a major role in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. The CNT was affiliated with the International Workers Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the [[Confederación General del Trabajo]] (CGT) and the [[CNT]]. CGT membership was estimated to be around 100,000 for the year 2003.<ref>Carley, Mark "Trade union membership 1993-2003" (International:SPIRE Associates 2004)</ref> Other active syndicalist movements include the US [[Workers Solidarity Alliance]] and the UK [[Solidarity Federation]]. The revolutionary industrial unionist [[Industrial Workers of the World]], claiming 2,000 paying members, and the [[International Workers Association]], an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the [[First International]], also remain active.

===The Russian Revolution===
{{main|Russian Revolution of 1917}}
[[Image:Goldmanberkman.jpeg|thumb|right|Anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] resisted [[Bolshevik]] consolidation of power following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].]]
Anarchists participated alongside the [[Bolsheviks]] in both February and October revolutions, many anarchists initially supporting the Bolshevik coup. However, the Bolsheviks soon turned against the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, a conflict that culminated in the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]]. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned or driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks. In the [[Free Territory (Ukraine)|Ukraine]], anarchists fought in the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] against Whites and then the Bolsheviks as part of the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]], who attempted to establish an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]] were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticizing the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, [[Bakunin]]'s predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule<ref name="bakuninmarx">"You can see quite well that behind all the democratic and socialistic phrases and promises in Marx’s program for the State lies all that constitutes the true despotic and brutal nature of all states, regardless of their form of government." Bakunin, Mikhail (1872) "[http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/works/1872/karl-marx.htm On the International Workingmen's Association and Karl Marx]" in ''Bakunin on Anarchy'', translated and edited by Sam Dolgoff, 1971</ref> had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; [[Communist party|Communist parties]] grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the US, for example, certain members of the major syndicalist movements of the [[Confédération générale du travail|CGT]] and [[IWW]] left the organizations and joined the [[Comintern|Communist International]].

In Paris, the [[Dielo Truda]] group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included [[Nestor Makhno]], concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the [[Platformism|Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)]],<ref name=Platformtext>{{cite book | last = Dielo Trouda group | authorlink = Dielo Trouda | title = Organizational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft) | origyear = 1926 | url = http://www.anarkism.net/newswire.php?story_id=1000 | accessdate = 2006-10-24 | year = 2006 | publisher = FdCA | location = Italy}}</ref> was supported by some communist anarchists, though opposed by many others. Platformist groups today include the [[Workers Solidarity Movement]] in Ireland and the [[North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists]] of North America.

===The fight against fascism===
{{main|Anti-fascism}}{{See also|Anarchism in Italy|Anarchism in France|Anarchism in Spain}}
[[Image:CNT-armoured-car-factory.jpg|thumb|Members of the anarchist [[CNT]] construct [[armoured car]]s in one a [[collectivisation|collectivised]] factory to fight against the [[fascist]]s in [[Spain]], 1936.]]
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of [[fascism]] in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] played a key role in the anti-fascist organisation ''[[Arditi del Popolo]]'', which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions and marked up numerous successful victories, including repelling [[Blackshirts]] in the anarchist stronghold of Parma in August 1922.<ref>Holbrow, Marnie, [http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=8205 "Daring but Divided"] (''Socialist Review'' November 2002)</ref> In France, where the [[far-right leagues]] came close to insurrection in the [[February 1934 riots]], anarchists divided over a '[[United Front]]' policy.<ref>Berry, David. "Fascism or Revolution". ''Le Libertaire''. August 1936)</ref> 

In Spain, the [[CNT]] initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the ruling class responded with an attempted coup, and the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936-1939) was underway. In response to the army rebellion, an [[Anarchism in Spain|anarchist-inspired]] movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of [[Barcelona]] and of large areas of rural Spain where they [[collectivization|collectivized]] the land. But even before the eventual fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the [[Stalinists]], who controlled the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from [[Soviet Russia]]. The CNT leadership often appeared confused and divided, with some members controversially entering the government.{{Or|date=December 2007}} According to [[George Orwell]] and other foreign observers, Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both [[POUM|dissident Marxists]] and anarchists.

Since the late 1970s anarchists have been involved in opposing the rise of [[neo-fascism|neo-fascist]] groups.{{Specify|date=December 2007}} In Germany and the [[United Kingdom]] anarchists worked within [[militant]] [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] groups alongside members of the [[Marxist]] left.

==Internal issues and debates==
{{main|Issues in anarchism}}
[[Image:Uroligheder3.jpg|thumb|right|The efficacy and legitimacy of using [[violence]] to political ends [[Anarchism and violence|have been controversial issues amongst anarchists]].]]
<!-- In the interest of restricting article length, please limit this section to two or three short paragraphs and add any substantial information to the main Issues in anarchism article. Thank you. -->
Anarchism is a philosophy which embodies many diverse and heterogeneous attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of [[anarchism and capitalism|capitalism]] (which anarchists usually reject, according to the ''[[Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]''<ref name=oxcom/>), [[anarchism and nationalism|nationalism]] and [[anarchism and religion|religion]] with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys a complex relationship with ideologies such as [[Anarchism and Marxism|Marxism]], [[Issues in anarchism#Communism|communism]] and [[Anarchism and anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalism]]. Anarchists may be motivated by [[humanism]], [[Christian anarchism|divine authority]], [[ethical egoism|enlightened self-interest]] or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as [[civilization]], [[technology]] (e.g. within [[primitivism]] and [[insurrectionary anarchism]]), and [[Issues in anarchism#Participation in statist democracy|the democratic process]] may be sharply criticized within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others. Anarchist attitudes towards [[Issues in anarchism#Race|race]], [[Issues in anarchism#Gender|gender]] and [[Issues in anarchism#The environment|the environment]] have changed significantly since the modern origin of the philosophy in the eighteenth century.

On a tactical level, while [[propaganda of the deed]] was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the [[Nihilist movement]]), contemporary anarchists espouse alternative methods such as [[nonviolence]], [[counter-economics]] and [[Crypto-anarchism|anti-state cryptography]] to bring about an anarchist society. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many [[definitional concerns in anarchist theory]].
